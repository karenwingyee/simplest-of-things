                    	<li>Make lemons last longer by storing them in water </li>
    					<li>Don’t have a cork? Put a spoon in a bottle of wine to make the fizz last for longer</li>
    					<li>Separate bananas from the rest of your fruit.</li>
    					<li>Freeze things such as bread, mince and even milk. </li>
    					<li>Having a Mexican night? Keep your guacamole green and fresh by spraying cooking oil on it.</li>
    					<li>Don’t store onions and potatoes together</li>
    					<li>Keep your apples and potatoes together, this way the potato doesn’t sprout.</li>
    					<li>Take the avocado stone out and place it with the other avocadoes to stop them going off</li>
    					<li>Store your onions in tights so that they last for longer</li>
    					<li>Don’t like the dry side of the cheese? Add a little bit of butter to it. </li>
