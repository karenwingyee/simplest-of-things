                    Boiling an egg. Sounds so simple and easy, right? Wrong. I like to think of myself as a pretty decent cook (as I'm sure my recipes show), yet up until last month I've never been able to boil an egg. My mum makes perfect ones, it's the first thing I ask for when I head home for a few days, and I've wasted countless boxes on trying to perfect it. 
                    <p>BUT NOW I’VE CRACKED IT!</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Crack the eggs into a medium sized bowl or a measuring jug. </li>

                            <li>Season it to taste using salt and pepper.</li>
                            <li>Get a saucepan and put it on a low heat (2-3) and add the butter.</li>
                            <li>Leave the butter to melt and make sure that it doesn’t bubble.</li>
                            <li>Once it’s all melted, pour your egg mixture in.</li>
                            <li>Keeping it on a low heat, stir the butter and the eggs together with a wooden spoon, and keep stirring every so often so the egg doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>

                        <p>You can make scrambled eggs in the microwave! That’s right, save the washing up (because I know how much you hate it) and use just one bowl to get the same results. Gino D'acampo swears by it! </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You need to use a microwave-proof container and begin by putting a tsp of cooking oil in it.</li>
                            <li>Add your eggs into the container and whisk them with a fork. Add your milk and season with salt and pepper. </li>
                            <li>Cover with cling film and make a small vent. Pop in the microwave on a medium to high power for 1 minute and then give it a stir. Then do it for a further minute. Keep doing this for a minute at a time until they’re how you want them. </li>
                            <li>Take them out and let them stand covered for a minute. Then enjoy!  </li>

                        <li>Cover the pan with the lid provided and cook for 4 minutes on a low heat still.</li>
